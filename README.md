# Hey I'm Josh!


After growing up in Central Maryland and enjoying the fruits of a successful high school lacrosse career, I went on to attend college in Pennsylvania at Messiah College to continue that passion and get an education.


After graduating from Messiah in 2011 with a Bachelor's of Arts in Sport Management and Communications, I started my college coaching career back at my alma mater and returned to school to pursue a Master's Degree in Collegiate Sports Administration.


With a degree in hand I went on to continue coaching. I picked up and moved to Wilmore, Kentucky, just south of Lexington, and started a program at Asbury Univeristy.


This is where we pick up the story. After the past four years as the Head Men's Lacrosse Coach and Sports Information Director I decided to take a leap of faith and head out on a career change. I enrolled in a web-development at Awesome Inc., in Lexington. During that time I spent 12-intensive weeks learning to development web applications with the likes of Javascript and PHP and their frameworks.


Below you'll find an overview of the skills I picked up there as well as a few examples of the work I was able to accomplish during my time there.
